## ðŸŒŸ Overview

This project leverages the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) to fetch cryptocurrency data and processes it through a series of steps: raw data fetching, preprocessing, feature engineering, and predictive modeling. The ultimate goal is to forecast cryptocurrency prices and trends using a robust and modular workflow.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- Fetches cryptocurrency data from the CoinGecko API.
- Preprocesses raw JSON files and converts them into structured CSV files.
- Engineers features like moving averages, exponential moving averages, and RSI.
- Generates price forecasts using ARIMA-based models.
- Modularized pipeline for extensibility and reuse.
- Automated analysis.
- Flask application to visualize the analysis.

## ðŸ§© Modules

### 1. DataFetcher

- Location: data_fetcher/coin_gecko_source.py
- Purpose: Fetches raw cryptocurrency data from the CoinGecko API.
- Key Methods:
    - get_coin_charts(coin_id): Fetches market chart data for a specific cryptocurrency.

### 2. DataProcessor

- Location: preprocessing/coin_gecko_preprocess.py
- Purpose: Converts raw JSON files to CSV format and performs basic data cleaning.
- Key Methods:
    - process_raw(): Processes all unprocessed raw files in the data directory.

### 3. FeatureEngineer

- Location: feature_engineering/coin_gecko_feature_engineering.py
- Purpose: Adds features like moving averages and RSI to processed data.
- Key Methods:
    - engineer_features(): Applies feature engineering to datasets based on their timeframes.

### 4. ModelGenerator

- Location: model_generator/coin_gecko_model_generator.py
- Purpose: Builds predictive models and generates forecasts using ARIMA.
- Key Methods:
    - fit(timeframe, steps): Fits a model and forecasts future prices for a given timeframe.

### 5. DataAnalysis

- Location: data_analyzer/coin_gecko_data_analyzer.py
- Purpose: Using the engineered and forecast data, generates the analysis.
- Key Methods:
    - process(): Reads the engineered and forecast data and generates basic analysis.
